<li><b>Country:</b> Select a country from the EU that reports railway incidents to the <a href="http://www.era.europa.eu">European Railway Agency (ERA)</a>. Selecting <i>All</i> takes all values from the <a href="http://erail.era.europa.eu/investigations.aspx">database</a>.
<li><b>Incident type:</b> Incident types are automatically extracted from the database, so for every entry here there should be at least one incident
<li><b>Time span:</b> Select a start and end year. Unfortunately not every country supplied data from 2000 onwards, since 2005 it gets more reliable.
